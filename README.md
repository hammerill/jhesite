# "J'hésite..." for Prépacode
An extension for [Prépacode](https://www.prepacode-enpc.fr/) that lets you tell if you hesitate to answer the question in order to revise better.

---

Une extension pour [Prépacode](https://www.prepacode-enpc.fr/) qui vous permet de dire si vous hésitez à répondre à la question pour mieux réviser plus tard.

## Why?
While revising the french Code de la route, I've seen that there were some questions that I could answer correctly, but in fact I was hesitating as hell and just had to know later whether I got it right.

This extension will allow to see these questions at a glance of the eye! Also it will show the inverse: if you did not hesitate but got it wrong.

## How?
This extension will add a new response button - <kbd>J'hésite...</kbd>.

Look at how it will look like:

![J'hésite button](./pics/examples/jhesite-button.png)

**Note**: if you prefer using keyboard (like me), you could click this button with <kbd>J</kbd>.

Then, in the results table you will no longer have green and red squares only, there will appear also the yellow and black ones:

Icon | Name | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
![Success icon](./pics/examples/1-success.png) | Success | You did not hesitate and could answer correctly. Bravo! Nothing to revise.
![Hesitated icon](./pics/examples/2-hesitated.png) | Hesitated | You hesitated but could answer correctly. Lucky! Remember this one.
![Failed icon](./pics/examples/3-failed.png) | Failed | You hesitated and couldn't answer correctly. Well, now you'll learn something.
![Fatal icon](./pics/examples/4-fatal.png) | Fatal | You didn't hesitate and yet couldn't answer correctly. Very confident in yourself heh? Maybe you must read the question better.

Also it will show how much questions did you hesitate on (a number to be reduced by time...).

## When?
As you may see, the extension is still not there.

I don't know when will it be done. It's my first time making a web extension.
