An extension for [Prépacode](https://www.prepacode-enpc.fr/) that lets you tell if you hesitate to answer the question in order to revise better.

---

Une extension pour [Prépacode](https://www.prepacode-enpc.fr/) qui vous permet de dire si vous hésitez à répondre à la question pour mieux réviser plus tard.

## Why?
While revising the french Code de la route, I've seen that there were some questions that I could answer correctly, but in fact I was hesitating as hell and just had to know later whether I got it right.

This extension will allow to see these questions at a glance of the eye! Also it will show the inverse: if you did not hesitate but got it wrong.
